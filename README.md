Creating a custom API at the server-end using express-JS to handle (API) requests(POST requests typically) from the front-end.
This Custom API decides what needs to be served to the front-end/Client.
Also integrated JSON Object literal (recipeJSON ,again no Third party services involved) 
later I parsed it to JSON Object using "JSON.parse" in order to access the data efficiently.
